**IIT & ELITE INSTITUTIONS PLACEMENT DECLINE DASHBOARD (2019-2024)**

This is the final, human-written README, tailored to emphasize your advanced work in **Prompt Engineering and LLM-driven Data Generation** alongside your analytical and rapid prototyping skills.

##  Project README: IIT & Elite Placement Decline Dashboard (2019-2024)

###  Project Overview and Goal

This project is a high-impact, interactive 6-tab dashboard designed to conduct a deep and diagnostic analysis of the **sharp decline in campus placements** experienced by elite Indian institutions for the 2024 graduating class.

The project's goal was not just to visualize data, but to overcome a common challenge in analysis—lack of real-world access—by **generating a statistically relevant dataset** and deploying a robust, functional prototype quickly. This approach showcases strong analytical interpretation, Prompt Engineering expertise, and efficiency in development.

**Timeframe:** September 2025 – October 2025 (Completed as a structured Course Project)

###  Data Generation and Methodology (Critical Technical Contribution)

To perform this analysis without access to proprietary student data, I implemented a cutting-edge data generation methodology:

* **LLM Data Synthesis:** I utilized a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate the comprehensive dataset of over **7,000 synthetic student records**.
* **Prompt Fine-Tuning:** I systematically **fine-tuned the LLM and the generation prompts** until the output accurately reflected key market realities, ensuring the synthetic data was statistically representative of known trends, including factors like package tiers, academic performance, and institutional categories. This demonstrated advanced **Prompt Engineering** skills.

###  Analytical and Prototyping Highlights

The final dashboard provides high-value insights delivered through efficient development:

* **Key Analytical Findings:** Successfully processed and interpreted the 7,000+ records to pinpoint the complex factors driving the decline, moving beyond simple aggregates to detailed trend analysis.
* **What-If Scenario Simulator:** Engineered a dynamic "What-If Scenario Simulator" using multi-factor filters (Year/Tier/Institution/Department) to allow stakeholders to perform rapid, customized data exploration and test hypothetical scenarios.
* **Skill Gap Intelligence:** Designed sophisticated visual reports detailing department-specific **skill gaps** (e.g., Cloud, AI for Computer Science; VLSI for ECE) to provide actionable feedback for curriculum and placement strategy improvement.
* **Rapid Development:** The interactive 6-tab dashboard, including full CRUD operations, was built **entirely using no-code tools**. This showcases the ability to deliver complex, functional prototypes quickly and efficiently.
